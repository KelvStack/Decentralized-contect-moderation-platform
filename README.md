### Data Models

#### Content
```clarity
{
    content-id: uint,
    author: principal,
    content-hash: (buff 32),
    status: string-ascii,
    votes-for: uint,
    votes-against: uint,
    voting-ends-at: uint
}
```

#### Stake
```clarity
{
    moderator: principal,
    amount: uint,
    locked-until: uint,
    active: bool
}
```

#### Challenge
```clarity
{
    content-id: uint,
    challenger: principal,
    stake-amount: uint,
    challenge-time: uint,
    resolved: bool,
    successful: bool
}
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Clarity CLI
- Stacks blockchain node
- STX tokens for testing
- Node.js and npm (for testing interface)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KelvStack/decentralized-content-moderation.git
cd decentralized-content-moderation
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Deploy the contract:
```bash
clarinet contract deploy
```

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Submitting Content

```clarity
(contract-call? .content-moderation submit-content <content-hash>)
```

### Voting on Content

```clarity
(contract-call? .content-moderation vote <content-id> <approve>)
```

### Staking Tokens

```clarity
(contract-call? .content-moderation stake-tokens <amount>)
```

### Challenging Decisions

```clarity
(contract-call? .content-moderation challenge-decision <content-id>)
```

### Reporting Content

```clarity
(contract-call? .content-moderation report-content <content-id>)
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Smart Contract Security
- Time-lock mechanisms prevent rapid stake manipulation
- Cooldown periods prevent spam attacks
- Stake requirements prevent Sybil attacks
- Multiple validation layers for critical operations

### Economic Security
- Stake slashing discourages malicious behavior
- Challenge system provides economic incentives for truth
- Reputation system creates long-term value alignment

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions
- Reputation requirements
- Stake-based privileges
- Time-based restrictions
